# You should place all your build steps in this script which will be run by our automated build pipeline
# This script is run from the project root - you can cd around as you need to
# Your build steps should build your game to a root-level output folder as demonstrated below, this folder is then uploaded to our servers
# If you require any specific software to be installed please consult your BBC Technical Lead/TPM
# If the build fails you should receive an email with failure information
# When you commit the following line, you can check the pipeline is working by checking the gettingstarted.txt file on the Test environment (get the URL from TPM)
