# Tech Review Tool

The Tech Review tool is a Chrome Extension that appears as a tab in Developer
Tools. It contains automated checks to analyse performance and source files
for CBBC and CBeebies games.
  
Please run the tool to ensure everything is to the standard we need it. We 
also run the tool, so getting all checks passing early 
means less back and forth when it comes to getting the game live.


## Installation

Install the [BBC Digital Children's Games Tech Review Tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bbc-digital-childrens-gam/obhojgkahkhapohjnijhehgfkpceogcb) from the Google Web Store.


## Using the Extension

* Visit a game webpage that requires a technical review (such as http://play.test.bbc.co.uk/play/pen/{GID})
* Open developer tools and click on Tech Review tab

For accurate results:

* ensure cache 'Disable cache' is not ticked on the Network tab 
* right click the reload button and choose 'Empty Cache and Hard Reload' 
(developer tools must be open for this option to exist)
* click run as often as you like, but wait for the game to fully load before 
utilising results
