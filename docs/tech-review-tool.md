# Tech Review Tool

The [BBC Digital Children's Games Tech Review Tool][tech review tool web store] 
is a Chrome Extension that appears as a tab in Developer Tools. It 
contains automated checks to analyse performance and release files for CBBC 
and CBeebies games.
  
Please run the tool to ensure everything is to the standard we need it, as 
failing tests may delay the game's release.

See [Tech Review Tool on Github][tech review tool github] for installation 
and usage instructions.
