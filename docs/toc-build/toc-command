This is for internal use only. If you are an agency, you do not need to
read this.

To create the table of contents for the main README, we are using a program
called gh-md-tod, version 0.4.1 for Mac (https://github
.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc.go).

It reads the .md files in order and produces a TOC. Update this command when
new .md files are added, run the command from this *root* directory and
copy/paste the new TOC into README.md.

Also remember to include a link back to the README at the bottom of each .md
file:
