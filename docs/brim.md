# Brim

Brim is the name given to a [technique](https://github.com/gajus/brim) widely 
adopted by the web industry to workaround issues with Safari's UI 
intruding into the screen during game play. It allows the user to swipe up, 
tap the screen or rotate the device to dismiss the browser UI and return the 
game to full screen.
