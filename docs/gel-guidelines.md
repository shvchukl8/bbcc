# GEL Games Framework Guidelines, Accessibility and Icon Assets

GEL (Global Experience Language) helps the BBC provide a consistent 
experience across all content and devices.

## Guidelines

The guidelines, to which the game **must** adhere, consist of the 
following documents:

**GEL Games Framework** details the game screens, how they should be linked and the 
elements they should contain.

**Accessibility** specifies what is required and what is recommended to make 
the game accessible.

**GEL Icon Asset Pack** provides the icons which must be used; they may be 
skinned but the pictorial shape and size must remain.  

### In-game audio for devices must respect user choice
The ringer/silent switch (iOS) or mute (Android) on a device should silence in-game audio. Therefore audio should NOT play if the device is silenced or muted. This follows guidelines from Android and iOS platforms.

## Toolkit 

**Toolkit** explains the process of evaluating the quality of the game in 
regards to the GEL guidelines and in relation to the target audience. 
Evaluations are performed throughout the project by the BBC which may inform 
changes for the agency to respond to.

**Personas** are to be used as part of the evaluation process.
